0.3.0  2023-01-15T11:45:37-07:00
    - Initial Trello syncronization (one-way)
    - [bugfix] Config file reader now tests for readability rather than
      existance of config files.
    - Config files can now be split into "public" and "secret" parts
      which may be useful for people who use github or similar to manage
      their dotfiles.  ~/.task.yaml continues to be the main config file,
      but if ~/.task.secret.yaml exists, it can contain additional
      configuration that is merged with the contents of .task.yaml (using
      Hash::Merge).

      "monitor"

0.0.19  2021-01-18T13:25:04-07:00

    - [BUGFIX] Tasks with no display frequency now properly display

0.0.8  2018-10-18T21:20:43-06:00
    - Implement "display frequency".  You can set this frequency with a
      task, representing how often the task will display. For instance, to
      a task every 3 days, set to "3".  The start day is based on the task-id,
      so it is essentially random.

      now.
